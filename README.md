# DSA-Using-Python
Data Structure and Algorithms
After 51 days of diving deep into the world of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) with Python, guided by the incredible Saurav Shukla on MySirG.com, I've successfully finished the course.

This journey included:
ðŸ”¹ 51 insightful and comprehensive videos
ðŸ”¹ 29 challenging assignments completed and uploaded on GitHub

The assignments are available for free alongside the course on their website: [MySirG Premium](https://premium.mysirg.com/).

Feeling accomplished and excited to apply these skills in real-world projects!
